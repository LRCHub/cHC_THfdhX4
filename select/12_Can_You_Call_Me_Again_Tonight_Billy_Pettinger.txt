Sometimes I don't want to be where I am, so I'll fall in love
It's the best way to get out of town and stop all the things that I've been thinking of

I know that you don't want to admit it but I know you've seen a couple things before
It isn't that I wanted to quit
It's just that I wanted something, and you weren't it

Sometimes I don't want to follow you down
But sometimes I don't want to go alone
It feels just like the best part's gone
Cause you don't talk, you don't call and you're never home

I have seen a couple things before
And I know the sound of someone giving up
I think I shouldn't say anymore
This is all I am and it ain't ever enough
This is all I am and it ain't ever enough

Are you out there waiting
For someone with something worth saying?
Can you call me again tonight?

Sometimes I don't want to wake up alone
But sometimes, people they just talk too loud
Do you ever fall asleep with your phone
Just in case someone calls to ask you out?

I've seen a couple things before
And I know the sound of someone giving up
I think I couldn't take anymore
This is all I am and it ain't ever enough
This is all I am and it ain't ever enough

Are you out there waiting
For someone with something worth saying?
Can you call me again tonight?
